# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

This project involved learning how hash tables work and how to implement them.
A hash table is a data structure that uses a hash function to map keys to array indices, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs.

## Learning Objectives

* What is a hash function
* What makes a good hash function
* What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
* What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
* What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
* What are the most common use cases of hash tables
